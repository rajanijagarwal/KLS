Analyzing Sleep data in Sleeping Beauty Syndrome
Kleine–LevinSyndrome(KLS), commonly referred to as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome,
is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia accompanied
by cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Due to the unpredictable and episodic nature of the
disorder, early detection remains a major clinical challenge. This study investigates whether

one hundred days of sleep duration, sleep architecture, and heart-rate measurements from a
single diagnosed KLS patient was analyzed. The research involved data cleaning, exploratory
analysis, feature engineering, and the evaluation of multiple machine-learning models, including
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The findings suggest that
lag-based sleep duration and physiological features provide predictive signals. However, dataset
size and subject diversity remain key limitations for clinical validation.
